# Pydantic v2 has soft incompatibility with v1, which is what all
# released versions of our software rely on. This is handled in a
# microrepo (openff-models) which will get a minor version bump
# when the new version(s) of things is released. One package
# (openff-interchange) serves as a fulcrum in our stack, so this
# is the minimal change that handles it for all of our packages
